#### Game Basics
- Move your mouse around the screen to move your cell.
- Eat food and other players in order to grow your character (food respawns every time a player eats it).
- A player's **mass** is the number of food particles eaten.
- **Objective**: Try to get as big as possible and eat other players.

#### Gameplay Rules
- Players who haven't eaten yet cannot be eaten as a sort of "grace" period. This invincibility fades once they gain mass.
- Everytime a player joins the game, **3** food particles will spawn.
- Everytime a food particle is eaten by a player, **1** new food particle will respawn.
- The more food you eat, the slower you move to make the game fairer for all.
